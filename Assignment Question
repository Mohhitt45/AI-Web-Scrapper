Task for AI software Engg.

Weâ€™re evaluating a solution for automated web data extraction with optional AI/NLP enrichment. Please review the scope below and share a working prototype along with code and documentation.

Objective
Build a system that scrapes target websites, cleans the data, extracts structured fields, and (optionally) enriches the results using AI/NLP.

Inputs
Target sources (e.g., company directories, e-commerce listings).
A list of URLs or a CSV containing company/profile links.

Core Scope
Web scraping/crawling with configurable rate limits and retries.
Cleaning/normalization (dedupe, trim, standardize phone/email/URLs).
Structured extraction (e.g., company name, website, address, phone, email, category, description, social links).
Output to CSV and/or in Tabular format.

Reporting / Visualization
Generate a simple run log/report.
Totals: profiles/records scraped.
Counts: complete vs. incomplete entries (e.g., missing email/phone), and error/retry stats.

Deliverables
Code (ZIP or Git repo link) with a clear README covering
